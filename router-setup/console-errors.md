# Browser Console Errors

Based on the console logs, here are the exact errors we're seeing:

## Warning Messages:
```
Warning: Missing `Description` or `aria-describedby={undefined}` for {DialogContent}.
```

## Error Patterns:
The main issues are not routing-related but rather:

1. **Redis Connection Warnings** (Backend):
   ```
   [WARN] Redis connection error, falling back to memory cache { error: 'connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379' }
   ```

2. **Authentication 401 Errors** (Expected):
   ```
   [ERROR] GET /api/auth/me - 401 (0ms) Error: Request failed
   ```

3. **Accessibility Warning** (Frontend):
   ```
   Warning: Missing `Description` or `aria-describedby={undefined}` for {DialogContent}.
   ```

## Router-Specific Observations:
- No router-specific errors in console
- Vite hot module replacement working correctly
- Form submissions processing successfully
- Trending data fetching operational

## Current Routing Approach:
We're using **wouter** (not React Router) with a custom routing component that:
- Uses `useLocation()` hook from wouter
- Implements catch-all logic with switch/case statements
- Falls back to NotFound component for unmatched routes
- Wraps everything in ErrorBoundary components

## Key Differences from React Router:
- No `createBrowserRouter()` - wouter uses `<Router>` component
- No `RouterProvider` - routes handled by custom component
- No `errorElement` prop - error handling via ErrorBoundary components
- Catch-all implemented via default case in switch statement
