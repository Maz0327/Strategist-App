# Navigation Redesign: Workspace-First User Experience

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**Before**: Users had to "dig for things" - Projects → Project Gallery → Select Project → Find Workspace Button → Open Workspace
**After**: Direct access via "My Workspaces" as the second main navigation item

## 🚀 New Navigation Flow

### Primary Navigation (Left Sidebar)
```
1. 🏠 Today's Briefing     (Overview + workspace shortcuts)
2. 📁 My Workspaces       (PRIMARY WORKFLOW - Direct workspace access)
3. ➕ Quick Capture       (Streamlined content capture)
4. 🎯 Strategic Brief Lab (Brief creation tools)
5. ⚙️ Manage             (System management)
```

### User Workflow Transformation

#### Old Workflow (5+ clicks):
```
Login → Projects → Browse Gallery → Select Project → Click Workspace → Open Workspace → Start Working
```

#### New Workflow (2 clicks):
```
Login → My Workspaces → Select Workspace → Start Working
```
